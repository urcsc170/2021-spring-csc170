# Course Syllabus: Introduction to Web Development

An introduction to Internet and Web technologies. Topics include Internet transport protocols, HTML5 and CSS3, Web page design and Website publishing. Emphasis is placed on fundamentals, design concepts and industry standards. Additional topics include: web site construction techniques, mobile design issues, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Programming with JavaScript will be introduced.

*The course will be 100% online with asynchronous parts (the lectures), and synchronous parts (the labs)*

## Course Section:<br>CSC 170-1 - Intro to Web Development

- Lectures (official): **Tues/Thurs 3:25 - 4:40 PM EDT**
- Credits: **4.0**
- Location: **Online Lectures and Labs**
- Delivery:  **Asynchronous, recorded videos available in Panopto**
  - As scheduled, students must watch recorded lecture videos in Panopto within 24 hours of being published on Tuesdays and Thursdays

**NEW this semester (Spring 2021):** this course usually requires students to register for scheduled lab sections in addition to the lecture section, during which lab assignments are distributed and completed.  Since this course is now 100% online and support asynchronous attendance, the lab sections have been discontinued.  However the lab *assignments* - usually two per week - will continue to be distributed (now online) and students will need to complete them by the due date indicated on each instruction sheet (usually within two days).

## Grading

For each assignment, a grading rubric will be provided. Rubrics will inform students how assignments are evaluated.  In the interest of fairness, extra credit and make-up work is not offered.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Lab Assignments**<br>There is lab work once or twice a week at the discretion of the instructor.  Each lab counts equally toward the total of 30%.  There will be around 15-18 lab assignments depending on current changes in the web development industry.<br>NOTE: each lab depends on the success of the previous so students need to keep-up and not skip labs. | **30%**<br>Each lab assignment will be worth about 1.6% of the overall grade |
| **Projects**<br>There are three projects during the semester. Each project depends on the success of the previous. | **70%**<br/>Project 1: 10%<br>Project 2: 35%<br>Project 3: 25% |

## Labs and Project Assignments
**Assignments** are made available via [the Course Documentation website](https://docs.csc170.org) after most lectures and can be completed independently on one's own Internet-connected computer (Mac or PC).  

**How to get help...**

While working on a lab or project assignment, students may need to ask questions answered and get extra instruction.  During a regular in-person semester, students would attend scheduled lab sections on campus where they could ask TAs for help.  In an online environment, we will use our class web server and Slack.

*When you get stuck working on an assignment...*

1. FTP (upload) the files you're working on to your account on [the class web server](https://csc170.org)

2. Check what you uploaded to the server in your web browser and copy the URL

3. Go to the [#help channel in Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T01HQCN33FX/C01HLMSE5SA) and create a post. Ask a SPECIFIC question and paste the URL

...one of the TAs will *start a thread* on your post to answer your question

**Note:** throughout the semester, the assignments build on each other, meaning: students cannot complete one assignment without successfully finishing the previous.  So, success in this course requires students to turn-in assignments on-time and in the right order.

### Due Dates
For each assignment and project, the **due date** is shown near the top of the lab or project instructions. To avoid a zero grade, assignments must be turned-in via Blackboard on or before their due date.  

Due to the online/asynchronous nature of the course, there is no specific *time* related to the due date.  (Disregard the due "time" seen in Blackboard.) You simply need to turn-in your assignment within 24 hours of the due date based on the time zone where you're located.

Within about **24-48 hours** of turning-in an assignment in Blackboard, the TAs will provide a grade ONE TIME only, and only if the assignment was submitted in Blackboard **on or before its due date**.  

Assignments turned-in after the due date will get a zero unless a prior arrangement has been made with the student's assigned TA.  See below...

### Late assignments

Late assignments will not be graded unless *a prior arrangement* has been made with the student's assigned TA to get an **extension by one or two days**.  Extensions will only be granted two or three times, maximum, per semester, at the discretion of the TA. 

## Texts and Materials
This course does not use a textbook. All information required to pass the course comes from the lectures and labs so attendance, virtual or in-person, is mandatory.  

### Personal Computer and Software
In addition to the hosted Web service, provided by the University, students will need to use a personal computer (PC or Mac) with specific capabilities and software installed:

- A code editor
- FTP software
- An updated, popular web browser
- An Internet connection
- A local "web stack" (in the second half of the semester)

If a student does not have a personal computer with these capabilities, the University provides open labs at various locations on campus that they can use directly or through remote access.  Those computers have all the required capabilities and software installed and they are supported by University IT.  

For reference: during lectures the professor will be using a **Macbook** and **Windows PC** (alternatively) and a code editor: **Sublime Text, version 3** ([www.sublimetext.com/3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)). For FTP demonstrations, the professor will use **Cyberduck** (for Mac, [cyberduck.io](http://cyberduck.io)) and **WinSCP** (for PC, [winscp.net/eng/download.php](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php)).  Demonstrations during the lecture and in labs will be done using **Google Chrome**.

Mid-way through the semester, the professor will introduce web server software that students can optionally install on their own computer.  The software can be installed using the free version of: MAMP (for both PC and Mac, www.mamp.info/en)

## Academic Honesty
Violation of the College's Honesty Policy is a serious violation of the trust upon which our academic community depends. A common form of academic dishonesty is plagiarism: the representation of another person’s work as one’s own, or the attempt “to blur the line between one’s own ideas or words and those borrowed from another source.” ([Council of Writing Program Administrators, December 30, 2019,](http://wpacouncil.org/aws/CWPA/pt/sd/news_article/272555/_PARENT/layout_details/false)). More specifically for CSC 170, **computer code (HTML, CSS, PHP, or JavaScript) submitted for grading, that was copied from another source in part or whole without acknowledgment is plagiarism**.  To protect yourself, in the programming world, citations of sources may be placed in the "code comments" of submitted files.

### Industry Practices
In the web development industry it is common for professional developers to inspect, i.e. look and study someone else's code for the purposes of *inspiration*.  In fact, that's how good developers get better, and in the industry, it's encouraged.  But here in academia there is a line between inspection for inspiration versus plagiarism.  Students must be very careful to not copy other students' code and submit it as their own without proper attribution.  In cases where plagiarism is evident, the University’s rules governing academic dishonesty will be followed. As required by College policy, all instances of plagiarism are reported to the College Board of Academic Honesty.  For the complete College honesty policy, see: [www.rochester.edu/college/honesty](http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty)

## Academic Assistance and Accommodations
Please know that this classroom respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds and abilities. Students are invited to talk with the professor about any concern or situation that affects their ability to complete their academic work successfully. Useful resources for all students include the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, located at **1-154 Dewey Hall** on the River Campus; telephone: **(585) 275-9049** or email <cetl@rochester.edu>

## Schedule
This [schedule (linked here)](schedule.md) is subject to modification throughout the semester.  Always check with the professor to answer questions about the schedule.
